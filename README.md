# Data-analysis-for-magnetic-field-expirement
This is a data analysis set of codes for a magnetic field sensing experiment.

It was created during a project on sensing magnetic fields in space.

This repository contains two folders: 

1- Geometry: Matlab codes to generate twist pair & circular geometries

2- Analysis codes: Matlab codes that take a data set (record of a simulation) and output plots of the magnetic field vs the current 

N.B. please make sure to change the name of imported data before running the code
